                <h3>School</h3>
                <p>Utemisov High School, located in the city of Atyrau, has a long and rich history. It was the very
                    first place that sparked my interest in programming. Since then, I have developed a strong passion
                    for it and continue to find immense joy and fascination in coding. My journey into the world of
                    technology began here, and it has shaped my ongoing enthusiasm for learning and improving my
                    skills.</p>

                <h3>Internship</h3>
                <p>I am currently preparing for interviews, and I strongly believe that an internship is crucial for my
                    success as a specialist. The unique environment and hands-on experience that one can gain only in a
                    workplace are invaluable. Internships not only provide practical skills but also allow for
                    networking and learning from industry professionals, which can greatly enhance my career prospects.
                    I see this as an essential step in my professional journey.</p>

                    has proven to be an incredibly valuable and beneficial resource for me. Through SDU, I have gained
