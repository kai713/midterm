                <h3>School</h3>
                <p>Utemisov High School, located in the city of Atyrau, has a long and rich history. It was the very
                    first place that sparked my interest in programming. Since then, I have developed a strong passion
                    for it and continue to find immense joy and fascination in coding. My journey into the world of
                    technology began here, and it has shaped my ongoing enthusiasm for learning and improving my

                    workplace are invaluable. Internships not only provide practical skills but also allow for
                    networking and learning from industry professionals, which can greatly enhance my career prospects.
